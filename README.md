My name is Idris Awad, but you may also know me as @Almost2Late. I am an IT security, AI, WEB3, and Blockchain enthusiast with a passion for coding, creating, breaking, and fixing things.

I have a diverse background, having worked as a tattoo artist, grayhat hacktivist, and a martial arts 剛柔流 sempai. My interests and skills have led me to explore the ever-evolving world of technology and security, and I am excited to share my projects and contributions with the community.

On this page, you will find a variety of projects related to IT security, AI, WEB3 and blockchain, as well as other projects that I find interesting and fun to work on. I invite you to take a look around, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoy what you find here!
